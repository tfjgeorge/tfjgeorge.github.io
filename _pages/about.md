I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Orange Labs](https://hellofuture.orange.com/fr/) in [Vincent Lemaire](http://vincentlemaire-labs.fr/)'s group.

My research interests include weakly supervised learning and generalization in deep neural networks. I am interested in trying to build bridges between deep learning training mechanisms and more established machine learning techniques such as linear models and ensemble methods.

I did my PhD at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/) in Québec, under the joint supervision of [Pascal Vincent](https://ai.facebook.com/people/pascal-vincent/) and [Guillaume Lajoie](https://www.guillaumelajoie.com/).
Previously, I was a multiple hats engineer at [Eco-Adapt](https://www.eco-adapt.com/?lang=fr) where I worked with time series from various industrial sensors, trying to develop automated algorithms to make sense of these data streams. Prior to that I studied at [École des Mines](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/).

Here is my [academic CV](/assets/pdf/thomas_george_academic_cv.pdf).
