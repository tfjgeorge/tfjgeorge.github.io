I am a Phd candidate at Mila in Québec, under the joint supervision of [Pascal Vincent](https://ai.facebook.com/people/pascal-vincent/) and [Guillaume Lajoie](https://www.guillaumelajoie.com/).

My research is focused on understanding the generalization properties of deep neural networks and develop efficient training techniques.

I was previously an engineer at [Eco-Adapt](https://www.eco-adapt.com/?lang=fr) where I worked with time series from various industrial sensors, trying to develop automated algorithms to make sense of these data streams.
