I am a researcher at [Orange Innovation](https://hellofuture.orange.com/fr/) in the *Responsible and Impactful AI* program.

My research interests include:
 - Generalization and explainability of deep neural networks
 - Weakly supervised learning
 - Causality in machine learning

I did my PhD at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/) in Québec, under the joint supervision of [Pascal Vincent](https://ai.facebook.com/people/pascal-vincent/) and [Guillaume Lajoie](https://www.guillaumelajoie.com/), followed by a post-doc in [Vincent Lemaire](http://vincentlemaire-labs.fr/)'s group.
Previously, I was a multiple hats engineer at [Eco-Adapt](https://www.eco-adapt.com/?lang=fr) where I worked on time series from industrial sensors, in order to implement automated algorithms to make sense of these data streams. Prior to that I studied at [École des Mines](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/).

Here is my [academic CV](/assets/pdf/thomas_george_academic_cv.pdf).
